Marathi is a local language but not every people like me can't understand Marathi language though iam born and broughtc^'p in Mumbai itself but till my schooling was done from different board wer Marathi language was not there and there are some my few friends who are proper Maharashtrian but don't know the native language but it's completely fine.. I mean why are you guyz creating hatred that Maharashtra meim rehena hai toh Marathi ani chaye!
