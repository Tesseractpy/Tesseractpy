I am not a big fan of Arnab Goswami but I think he has covered up news against BJP also like the Kuldeep Sengar case he criticized yogi govt, also criticized the Khattar govt in the murder of a child in Ryan international, also exposed the links b/w karni Sena and bjp and also presently criticizing the JD(U) and bjp in the Thakur rape case in Bihar so I don't think he is biased enough.
