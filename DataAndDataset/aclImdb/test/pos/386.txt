Hey, Ammu Hinduism had been progressive for long time. Infact it was a religion itself. There were works been written. Like 4 vedas then wrote 18 purans , 200 + upnishad, etc then some jerk wrote the laws of Manu which made strict rules. There is always an update needed in a religion. Sati is one of the bad example. There are many more which are needed to be updated or removed. Also one should never become a fan of any God Man or baba, if the Religion is wrongly interpreted by them it can lead to chaos. But I'm an Atheist and I don't believe in Karma. If everyone will stop believing in God and karma many might stop doing good work because they might think nobody's watching them and stop being Good. An atheist can be as a Religious Person. For eg. Savarkar was Atheist , Hitler was Anti-Christ. It's complex and Perplexing.
