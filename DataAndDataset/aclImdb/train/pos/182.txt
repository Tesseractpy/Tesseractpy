We have choosen you to make india better its your duty to take such actions that economy zooms. Leave all such things that indulge your MP or MLA in things like miss call for CAA or busy joining others to BJP rather put pressure to them to think or tryc^o get those points that are hindering small city buisnesses due to online purchases or other reasons. About 40 percent voters vote for bjp try to convince rest with social and economic duties rather than busy in showing numbers. Try to get mood of voters before elections and plz dont speak bad words for the opposition like in the case of kejriwal. BJP is known to be deciplined party let it be like that only.
